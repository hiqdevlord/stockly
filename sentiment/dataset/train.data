I am not sure whether this is a good entry point. It&rsquo;s a well established trend, so I would probably wait for a dip. In an uptrend, what you get is a series of higher tops and higher lows. So, we have seen the stocks make new highs, but the dip or pullback is still pending for these stocks. And these are also now quite overbought, if you take the short term possibilities. I think around Rs 3,200-3,250 which would be about 5-7% lower, could be a very good entry point for Infosys. Similarly, while I like

"Infosys' stock saw a spike in response to its 3QFY13 results and has moved in a range ever since. We believe that 3QFY13 may only have been the first quarter of a visible momentum in the company's growth, and that there is further upside in the stock from current levels. We present a series discussing Infosys' potential to build upon its impressive 3Q performance, in the first of which, we make a case for revenue growth convergence.

Why Ambit Cap wants you to sell Infosys and Wipro

Infosys board meeting will be held on January 11, 2013 to consider the audited financial results of the Company for the third quarter and nine months ending December 31, 2012 and the audited consolidated financial results of the company and its subsidiaries for the third quarter and nine months ending December 31, 2012.

 Margins are going to be kind of mixed bag if I look at the entire tier I as such. For instance, for Infosys, it is going to be the impact of mid-tier promotion cycle is going to come through. So, we are expecting close to 70 bps dip in the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin. At the same time, there are couple of headwinds like the rupee, which has appreciated quarter-on-quarter, which has averaged around 44.8 as oppose to the last quarter.

Infosys can go upto Rs 1950-2000: Baliga

 What is the role as far as corporate India is concerned? In the larger framework of society, I know that you are doing a lot of work through the Infosys Foundation whether its education, healthcare and so. But as a wider role, what is it that corporate India can actually do? Where is the room and what sort of push do you actually see?

Infosys' pipeline in 2HCY12 improved over 1HCY12. This was largely an outcome of measures taken by the company to ensure growth revival, than any macro improvement. This is reflected in two metrics in particular: 1. Growth outperformance at Business IT Services (BITS) segment v/s other segments in five out of the last seven quarters. 2. Decline in constant currency realization in three out of the last four quarters.

Indian ADRs: Infosys, Sterlite down 2%, Tata Motors up 1%

Nasscom's guidance of 12-14% growth in exports in FY14 is unlikely without growth acceleration at Infosys and Wipro. Cognizant guided for a deceleration in CY13 growth and even 17% growth at TCS explains only negligible acceleration at Nasscom. 23%+ of the rest of the exports comes from Infosys and Wipro. A large part of the remainder comes from MNC ITs, which may not grow as fast (considering Accenture's guided deceleration), implying onus of growth acceleration on the only remaining heavyweights, without which, meeting Nasscom's forecast becomes mathematically difficult.

Kapoor told CNBC-TV18, "IT is one sector, which has already factored in all the negatives. If you look at the very broad picture India still remains an outsourcing hub, I don&rsquo;t think it is so easy to change this view. Especially when it comes to software, Indian companies are doing well not only because of a cost advantage. They have very clearly at least the well-established companies like Infosys have clearly over the years established their capabilities of delivering quality products across various segments. So outsourcing and especially the software segment outsourcing is certainly on from India and India remains is focus for that."

Infosys Technologies is the top gainer on the Sensex. At 10:14 am, the share was quoting at Rs 1,795, up Rs 96.65, or 5.69%. It was trading with volumes of 84,435 shares. On Thursday the share closed up 3.68% or Rs 60.25 at Rs 1,698.35.

Infosys is a good medium term bet, says Atul Badkar of Edelweiss Securities.

In the largecap space, top gainers on the Sensex were ACC, Reliance Infra, Grasim, DLF and Infosys up 0.5-2%. On the losing side, Hero Honda, Hindalco, Sun Pharma, Tata Steel and NTPC were down 1-2%. 

 We agree to that. The current valuations of around 16.5-17 times one year forward seem quite expensive also these are build on somewhat stretch expectation. Expectations of dollar revenue growth for Infosys have now risen to 14 percent, which implies almost 12 percent organic growth.

, which had lost over 118 points in the previous two sessions, fell further by 107.13 points or 0.55% at 19457.79 at 10.45 AM tracking losses in consumer durable, auto and information technology stocks.

Negative contributors to the Sensex are Reliance, Infosys, ICICI Bank and Bharti Airtel.

He further added, &ldquo;Going ahead as well for YoY, atleast for the next 2-3 years they should be able to show growth of around 20-24%, so with that sort of growth at these levels these stocks are looking extremely cheap. A stock like Infosys should see levels of around Rs 1,950-2,000 and a stock like Satyam should see levels of Rs 480-500.&rdquo;

While you are looking at India as a stock, you need to monitor the universe as well like when the market tanks 10% as good as stock as Infosys or HDFC Bank or Bharti maybe they will also fall with the market. They have the market risk attached to it and if you look at India as a stock, then the universe is the emerging market basket. 

Technical Analyst, Deepak Mohoni is of the view that one can hold Infosys Technologies. Technology is getting a bit interesting now because this is only sector, which has been in a decline since the start of 2007. It is possible that they are back in a long-term uptrend now and investment interest is returning at these levels.

Infosys offered to pay Rs 100 crore, out of Rs 400 crore, that was to be used to build this elevated highway. Finally, it turned out that the person who bid the best offered to pay the government a bit of money, instead of the government paying him, otherwise we would have paid Rs 100 crore. I think that argument is not null and void.

&ldquo;The uncertainties on global front has decreased the prospects of technology spending in FY13 but outsourcing is expected to be on a positive trend and tier-1 players are expected to post double digit dollar revenue growth. Rupee depreciation will help rupee revenue growth &amp; margins. The value proposition of Indian IT firms remains intact as enquiries for outsourcing increases and more verticals &amp; geographies open up along with growth in the main market of US. We have further lowered volume estimates and revised INR/USD rate to 48 for FY12 &amp; 49 for FY13 (earlier 47.5 for FY12 &amp; 46.5 for FY13) leading to change in earnings estimates by 3-6% for FY13. We arrive at a target price of Rs 3,050 for Infosys factoring 18x FY13E EPS of Rs 1 69.6, target price of Rs 1,215 for TCS factoring 19x FY13E EPS of Rs 63.9, target price of Rs 420 for Wipro factoring 16x FY13E EPS of Rs 26.2 and target price of Rs 470 for HCL Tech factoring 13x FY13E EPS of Rs 36.1.,&rdquo; says PINC Research report.

   they have great amount of supports, just about 1-2% lower from current levels. Once this pattern on CNX-IT breaks out actually we can see a very good move in all the IT stocks especially the front line IT stocks like Infosys or TCS. So the open interest built up that we had seen yesterday along with this pattern I think the index is getting ready for a break out now. So I would stay bullish on this particular sector at this point of time.&rdquo;

Baliga told CNBC-TV18, "We have been recommending people to buy IT stocks for the past one and half to 2 months. Even at these levels we are recommending because most of them we still feel are decently cheap. Stocks like Satyam and Infosys should give QoQ growth of atleast 4-5% and in Satyam we are looking at growth of around 5.5% for this quarter.&rdquo; 

This company is growing at about 5.5 percent organic growth rate for FY13. It is quite stretched to assume that it will go from 5.5 percent to 12 percent in a span of a year. For Infosys, expectation seems to be on higher side and if they do not come through then there will be multiple contractions as well. Infosys is one of our strongest sell ideas right now.

Sanket Akerkar, MD, Microsoft Corporation India, Som Mittal, president, Nasscom, Amar Babu, MD , Lenovo India, Debjani Ghosh, MD-South Asia, Intel and V Balakrishnan, member of the board, Infosys explain, on CNBC-TV18, that Internet connectivity and digital literacy are key to boost the IT sector in India.

So, the earlier generation of Infosys, Wipro and TCS were pretty fine when it came to doing that level of services entrepreneurship. It was in a most risk free way. We call it the the saaste mein karlenge (SMK) sector. So, at one point two things happened, one that to really create another saaste mein kaarlenge company, needed to have 5000-10000 people and a huge scale. Today that huge scale is out of the reach of lot of young startups.

So probably if I had to buy it today, I would keep a stop loss of as a swing target of about Rs 2706, because it closed at Rs 2775, 2-3%, Rs 2840 is where I would see there is resistance.&rdquo;

Moreover, the wage hike for FY12 is likely to be lower than FY11. 4) Europe is delivering strong growth in manufacturing, retail, utility and healthcare, whereas growth in the US is more broad-based. France and Germany is the key growth driver in Europe. 5) Spending in BFSI continues to be driven by regulatory and risk management.&rdquo;

Technical Analyst, Vijay Bhambwani is positive on Infosys Technologies, Tata Consultancy Services.

Hold Infosys Technologies, says Rajesh Jain, Independent Market Strategist.

 was lacklustre in trade and was hovering around its previous closing value. Select heavyweights like NTPC, SAIL, Bharti Airtel, Infosys, ITC, L&amp;T, ICICI Bank and HUL were seeing profit booking after yesterday's run up. However, buying continued in auto and select banking stocks. ONGC, TCS, DLF, Sterlite Industries, Reliance Infrastructure, Hindalco, Tata Power, HDFC, SBI, PNB and ACC were the other gainers. On the global front, European markets were quiet in trade.

"Our previous published target on Infosys was Rs 2,100 odd. We are revising our numbers. It will be in the region of 20 percent downside," he tells CNBC-TV18.

uying continues in the benchmark indices though there is some volatility. Shares of Reliance Industries, Reliance Petroleum, telecom, banking, metal, power, cement, auto, realty and capital goods companies are witnessing buying interest. Midcap and small cap stocks are following the same trend. However, selling continues in ONGC, Infosys, Wipro, TCS, BPCL and Hero Honda.

Indian ADRs: ICICI Bank, MTNL, Infosys, HDFC Bank, Wipro, Satyam down while VSNL up.

Bhamre told CNBC-TV18, "Infosys, in fact the entire IT space has been out performer and rally from Rs 3000 levels to current levels of Rs 3375-3380 has been quite phenomenal and has seen lot of formation of long positions, probably because people where flying to safety in terms of earnings growth or probably from corporate governance perspective, so lots of long positions are standing. We anticipate long unwinding and profit booking in IT space, so we are suggesting to short Infosys around Rs 3400, fix a stoploss of around Rs 3445 or something and we are expecting a downfall of Rs 100-140 points. So, Rs 3260-3270 is what we are anticipating."

Monal Desai of Sunidhi Securities has recommended buying Infosys around Rs 2,300 with a stoploss below Rs 2,285.

Jain says, &ldquo;I have a twin suggestion for the investor. He should continue to hold what he has because he is already deep in the money and therefore he has an expanded margin of safety on the holding that he has. We are at a 52-week high and perhaps the merit of buying at this level is not too strong. If you look at the global developments in the IT sector and the outlook for Indian IT majors like Infosys, I think practically everything is positive. Infosys itself is sitting on a huge cash reserve as usual and there are acquisition opportunities particularly in Latin America. So, if Infosys pursues all these things then coupled with higher billing rates, margin sustenance and continued recruitment, Infosys should continue to give good traction in terms of growth. But given the fact that you are at a 52-week high, I think he has the potential to accumulate at lower levels. Given the fact that you are likely to see Forex volatility continue to impact the bottom-line, I think he will get atleast a 5-10% cheaper entry point which is when he should look at increasing his holdings in Infosys. It&rsquo;s a safe core portfolio investment that he has and he must continue with it because on a YoY basis through the 2011-12 months, he will easily get a 20% gain on the stock.&rdquo;

After all, they see what Infosys is the first among equals. You have to work in a team. The difference is that Nandan is the big picture man; Kris is very reflective and intellectually extremely deep. Frankly, I would say of all the seven founders of Infosys, Kris and Shibu are the brightest intellectuals.

Markets choppy; RIL, Infosys, ICICI Bank drag

Indian ADRs: Infosys, Tata Motors, Wipro, Satyam, HDFC Bank plunged, while MTNL, Dr Reddy's Lab, ICICI Bank and Patni Computer surged.

However, NTPC, BHEL and Tata Power gained 2-2.5%; Infosys was the leader on Sensex, rising 1%.

Due to the economic downturn, developed nations are increasingly placing a lot of focus on efficiency spending where India has proven excellence and will continue to lead in the future too. In innovation-spending, Indian companies are taking the next step. The Infosys 3.0 programme is an attempt to cater to this trend and plans to create an IT solutions platform which will enable the clients to grow faster and become much more competent in the global marketplace. 

Dipesh Mehta, Nirmal Bang Securities is of the view that one can book profit in Infosys at current level.

By 2012, 30 percent of Infosys&rsquo; staff will be comprised of foreigners. It&rsquo;s a common refrain across the top 100 firms in India Inc. But managing diversity is not just about recognising differences in nationalities; it is just as much about race, gender, capabilities and age. 

Technology stocks have witnessed continuous battering despite favourable market conditions. The Nifty has outperformed technology stocks by 30% in the last year. However, with the approaching result season we expect closure of short positions to take place among technology heavyweights. Infosys is expected to remain an outperformer in the coming sessions 

At 1:24 pm, Infosys Technologies was quoting at Rs 2,501, down Rs 7.4, or 0.3% with volumes of 29,045 shares. Its marketcap is Rs 143,385.25 crore. Currently it is 134.84% above the 52-week low of Rs 1,065.

Hold Infosys Technologies, says A Kapoor  - Moneycontrol.com

  , we are expecting fair amount of margin gains there because last quarter these companies saw utilisations dipping off on the back of strong hiring that they have done, moving away from the just in time hiring that they traditionally use to go in for. These pressures are expected to come in for billing this quarter. So, utilisation is going to help them better as compared to the other Infosys and TCS. We are expecting close to 30 bps gains for Wipro and for HCL Tech we expect around 20 bps gains in the margins.

Buy Infosys with a target of Rs 2,660 per share and stop loss below Rs 2,530 per share.

Short Infosys Technologies: Ajit Surana

Mohoni told CNBC-TV18, "Technology is getting a bit interesting now because this is only sector, which has been in a decline since the start of 2007. So that seems to have changed now little bit because after Monday&rsquo;s move the Infosys and many of the technology stocks were at something like two-months high. We have not seen anything better than a one or two-week high for the whole year. So it is possible that they are back in a long-term uptrend now and investment interest is returning at these levels. So at the moment it is a hold definitely, perhaps a buy maybe a little ambitious because there are so many other stocks, which are on a safer uptrends."



Ashish Kapoor, CEO of Investshoppe is of the view that one can hold Infosys Technologies. The company has the capability of delivering reasonable returns but not extraordinary returns. The company has used this period of weakness to expand their capabilities, to strengthen relationship with existing customers.
